# Space Biology Keyword Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Next.js application that visualizes the frequency of keywords in a dataset of space biology research papers. The application reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and displays the top keywords in a bar chart. It is styled with Tailwind CSS and uses a modern, visually appealing design.

## Design and Features

### Color Palette

*   **Background**: `#0A0A0A` (Almost Black)
*   **Text**: `#E0E0E0` (Light Gray)
*   **Primary**: `#2EC4B6` (Turquoise)
*   **Secondary**: `#3A86FF` (Blue)
*   **Accent**: `#9EE493` (Light Green)

### Typography

*   **Heading Font**: Outfit
*   **Body Font**: Inter

### UI Components

*   **Chart**: A responsive bar chart from the `recharts` library to display keyword frequency.
*   **Gradient Accent**: A subtle animated gradient is used for accents and backgrounds.
*   **Glassmorphism**: The chart container has a frosted glass effect, with a blurred background and a subtle border.

### Interactivity

*   **Hover Effect**: When hovering over a bar in the chart, it will have a "glow" effect.
*   **Tooltip**: The tooltip for the chart has been redesigned for better visibility and a more professional look.

### Layout

*   The main content is centered on the page with a generous amount of padding.
*   The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Current Plan

*   The current objective is to apply the custom design and theme to the application. This involves configuring Tailwind CSS, adding custom fonts, and applying the styles globally.
